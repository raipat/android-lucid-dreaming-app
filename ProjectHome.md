Lucid Dreaming App is an early attempt at using Android phone sensors to accurately detect and score sleep. The intention is to induce lucid dreams by notifying user during REM sleep.

Beta v0.7.1 includes two sensors: accelerometer for actigraphy and microphone for volume level monitoring.
I would greatly appreciate any help in making this app more useful and work better!

Future intentions: create a global actigraphy database with sleep, dreaming and lucid dreaming data!
